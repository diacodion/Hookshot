# Releases and updates

How Hookshot and the Hookshot Launcher are released on git.magicbean.dev, and how the launcher finds, checks and installs
them. This document is the same in both repositories, [MagicBeanDev/Hookshot](https://git.notrexed.dev/Hookshot/Hookshot/src/branch/main/docs/releases.md)
and [MagicBeanDev/LongshotLauncher](https://git.notrexed.dev/Hookshot/HookshotLauncher/src/branch/main/docs/releases.md).
How to make a release, step by step, is in each repository's **RELEASING.md**.

Hookshot's numbers start at **v3.0.0**; the launcher's are its own and start at **v1.0.0**. Nothing here reads or writes
GitHub, and nothing is compatible with Hookshot's 2.x updates (NotRexed/Hookshot's history is Hookshot's).

## In short

| | |
|---|---|
| **A release** | A Forgejo release of the repository: a tag, a page with the notes, and the product's files with `SHA256SUMS` and `SHA256SUMS.sig`. Nothing else: no package registry, no pointer files |
| **Two products** | Hookshot releases its **builders** (Windows and Linux). The launcher releases **itself**. Each from its own repository, with its own versions |
| **Three channels each** | `stable` (tag `vX.Y.Z`), `rc` (tag `vX.Y.Z-rc.N`, and every stable), `nightly` (every push to `main`). Read from the release list |
| **One key** | CI signs `SHA256SUMS` with the release key (ECDSA P-256). The launcher has the public key built in |
| **tools.lock** | The Windows builder's build tools are not in Hookshot's releases: `tools.lock` names each one (URLs, SHA-256, size) |
| **Tags, not release PRs** | A maintainer releases by pushing a tag. CI checks the number against the commits, builds, signs and publishes. Notes by git-cliff |
| **Updates** | The launcher installs and updates the builder of each build, and updates itself, from these releases. The builders and the game look for no update themselves |

## What a release is

Each version is one Forgejo release, made by `.forgejo/workflows/release.yml`:

| Hookshot (MagicBeanDev/Hookshot) | The launcher (MagicBeanDev/LongshotLauncher) |
|---|---|
| `HookshotBuilder-<v>-windows-x64.zip`: the Windows builder (its setup as `HookshotBuilder.exe`, the builder and Hookshot's sources in `HookshotBuilder\`, `tools.lock`, `VERSION`, and `recomplauncher.json` at the top) | `LongshotLauncher-<v>-windows-x64-setup.exe`: one self-contained program that installs itself (below); `LongshotLauncher-<v>-windows-x64-portable.zip`: the same program as `LongshotLauncher.exe` with its `portable` file |
| `Hookshot-<v>-x86_64.AppImage`: the Linux builder, with its tools and `recomplauncher.json` inside | `LongshotLauncher-<v>-x86_64.AppImage` |
| `tools.lock`: the tools the Windows builder downloads | |
| `SHA256SUMS`, `SHA256SUMS.sig` | `SHA256SUMS`, `SHA256SUMS.sig` |

`SHA256SUMS` is `sha256sum`'s format, one `<64 hex>  <name>` line per file. `SHA256SUMS.sig` is the base64 of the DER ECDSA
P-256 signature of `SHA256SUMS`'s exact bytes, by the release key. A release's files never change: a fix is the next version.

Release files are Forgejo attachments: `[attachment] MAX_SIZE` (2048 MB on git.magicbean.dev now) caps each file, and
`[repository.release] ALLOWED_TYPES` must stay empty (every type) for `.AppImage`, `.exe`, `.lock` and `SHA256SUMS`. The
site is behind Cloudflare, which refuses uploads over 100 MB: CI uploads to the organization variable `RELEASE_UPLOAD_API` (`FORGEJO_UPLOAD_API` to `release.py`), the instance's address
without Cloudflare in front, when it is set (RELEASING.md, One-time setup). Downloads are not limited.

CI makes each release with the job's own token (`forgejo.token`, given to `release.py` as `RELEASE_TOKEN`), with no
secret and no bot account: on a push or a tag in the
repository, Forgejo 17 gives it write access to that repository's every unit and to no other repository
(`routers/api/v1/permissions/repo_access.go`; read-only for a pull request from a fork). That covers every call
`release.py` makes: create a release, upload its files, edit and publish the draft, delete a nightly's release and its tag
(a tag that isn't protected). Each repository releases into itself only, so no other token or fallback is needed. The token ends with
the job. Forgejo 17 ignores a workflow's `permissions:` key, so the workflows have none.

## The channels

The channels are read from the repository's release list (`GET /api/v1/repos/<repo>/releases`), by the same rules in the
launcher (`Core/ReleaseManifest.cs`, `Newest`) and in `scripts/release.py` (`newest`, `channels`):

| Channel | Offers | For |
|---|---|---|
| `stable` | the newest `vX.Y.Z` that is published and not a pre-release | playing |
| `rc` | the newest `vX.Y.Z-rc.N` or `vX.Y.Z` that is published | trying the next version before it is stable |
| `nightly` | the newest `nightly-<count>-<8 hex>` that is published, by its count | every change, untested |

- A **draft** is on no channel. CI creates each release as a draft, uploads every file, and publishes it last, so a run
  that fails half way shows players nothing.
- **Pulling** a bad version is deleting its release, or setting it back to a draft: its channel then offers the one before
  by itself.
- The **nightlies** past the newest 5 are deleted, with their tags, by the run that makes a new one. Nothing else is pruned.
- Anything else in the list is on no channel: Hookshot's `tools` release, a 2.x tag, a git describe name.
- A nightly's count is the number of commits: for Hookshot since the fork (e2a4d45, "Rename the project to Hookshot"), for
  the launcher since its first commit.

**Each build has its channel, and the launcher has its own.** In the launcher, *Settings > Channel for new builds* picks
the channel a new build follows (each build keeps its own). *Settings > Launcher updates* picks the channel the launcher
updates **itself** from: LongshotLauncher's stable, rc or nightly, independent of any build's. It defaults to the channel
of the launcher the player installed (a stable launcher follows stable).

**No downgrades, no replays.** There is no pointer file to replay: the list is what it is. The launcher never updates a
build or itself to a lower version than the one it has on that channel, and never goes down by itself; going down is the
player's choice (building another channel's version, or `--rollback`). A server that serves an old list can only hold
updates back, not undo them.

## Signing

One release key signs every release of both products, in CI, from the organization secret `RELEASE_SIGNING_KEY`.

1. CI writes `SHA256SUMS` over the release's files, signs it (`scripts/release.py sign`), then checks the signature with
   the key the launcher is built with (`verify`, from `Core/ReleaseTrust.cs` or Hookshot's `scripts/release_keys.json`):
   a key the launcher does not trust stops the release in CI, not in every player's launcher.
2. The launcher checks the signature of `SHA256SUMS` with its built-in key (`SignedSums`), then each file it downloads
   against the SHA-256 `SHA256SUMS` gives, and, for the Windows builder, each tool against the SHA-256 `tools.lock` gives.
   A release without a valid signature is refused, and the window says why.

**Why ECDSA P-256:** the launcher checks signatures with .NET's own crypto (no package; .NET 10 has no Ed25519), and CI and
maintainers sign with the `openssl` command line, so `scripts/release.py` needs no Python package. Hand-written signature
code is how updaters get broken.

**Why one key in CI:** it is simple and every release, nightlies included, is signed the same way. The risk is a leaked
secret or runner: the key would then sign anything. A second, **offline** key for stables only (the launcher requiring it
for `vX.Y.Z`) can be added later without changing the files: a second signature file beside `SHA256SUMS.sig`.

Rotating the key: RELEASING.md, "Rotate the key".

## tools.lock (Hookshot)

The Windows builder needs build tools that are not Hookshot's own code: llvm-mingw, Python with the prompt packages, emsdk,
the CPM cache (FFmpeg, Vulkan and SPIR-V headers, VMA, dav1d), wgpu-native, the prebuilt files of `third_party`
(a64emit.dll, lld-link.exe, SDL2/SDL3, zbic.dll) and the play profile. They are not in the release: `tools.lock` names them.

```
tool <name> <version> <system> <sha256> <size> <dest> <prefix> <url> [<url> ...]
tool llvm-mingw 20261104 windows-x64 5521…40f 191037046 HookshotBuilder/tools/llvm-mingw llvm-mingw-20261104-ucrt-x86_64 https://git.notrexed.dev/Hookshot/Hookshot/releases/download/tools/5521…-llvm-mingw.zip https://github.com/mstorsjo/…
```

- **Installing.** The builder's setup (`builder/setup/setup.c`) and the launcher (`Core/ToolsLock.cs`, `Toolchains`) download
  each tool from the first URL that answers with the right bytes. They check its size and SHA-256 and unpack the archive's
  `<prefix>` folder as `<dest>` in the install. A tool another installed version has, with the same SHA-256 and unpacked
  the same way, is taken from it and not downloaded again. `scripts/tools.py install` does the same, for CI and developers.
- **Where the archives are.** Every tool is downloaded first from Hookshot's long-lived **`tools` release** (assets named
  `<sha256>-<name>.zip`). Where an archive came from (upstream for llvm-mingw, NotRexed/Hookshot's `builder-parts` release
  for the four taken from Hookshot) is its fallback URL, so no install depends on a repository we do not control alone. An archive Hookshot
  makes itself (Python with our packages, the CPM cache with dav1d, the prebuilt `third_party` files, the play profile) is
  only in the `tools` release, put there by `scripts/tools.py`. The `tools` release is never pruned and is on no channel.
- **Bumping a tool** is a pull request that edits `tools.lock`, with the archive uploaded by `scripts/tools.py mirror`,
  `add` or `assemble` (RELEASING.md, "Bump a tool"). The release workflow refuses a `tools.lock` that lacks a tool the
  builder needs (`tools.py check --require`), in its first job, before anything is built.
- **Today's lock.** Python, emsdk, the CPM cache and wgpu-native are taken as they are from Hookshot v2.1.0's Windows
  builder (NotRexed/Hookshot's `builder-parts` release), with their SHA-256. Llvm-mingw is upstream's. Three are still to
  make before the first release: the CPM cache with dav1d, the `third_party` prebuilt files and the play profile
  (RELEASING.md, One-time setup).
- **Linux.** The Linux builder is an AppImage that carries its tools (`scripts/linux/deps.sh` pins each download by its
  SHA-256), so `tools.lock` has no Linux lines.

## How the launcher reads it

`Core/Releases.cs`, `ReleaseManifest.cs`, `ReleaseTrust.cs`, `ToolsLock.cs`, `ToolsSource.cs`, `Toolchains.cs`,
`SelfUpdate.cs`:

1. **At start, and on Retry.** It reads Hookshot's release list and its own. For each of Hookshot's channels and for its
   own launcher channel, it takes the newest version (rules above). It opens that release's `SHA256SUMS` and checks the
   signature. A channel whose newest release is refused offers nothing, and the home says why.
2. **Builds.** Each build is offered its channel's newest Hookshot version when that is newer.
   - Windows: building a version downloads its `HookshotBuilder-<v>-windows-x64.zip` and its `tools.lock`, each checked
     against `SHA256SUMS`, then installs the zip and each tool (above) into `<home>/toolchains/<v>.part`. The folder is
     renamed when complete.
   - Linux: it downloads `Hookshot-<v>-x86_64.AppImage`, checks it, and unpacks it with its own `--appimage-extract`.
3. **Itself.** The launcher's own channel offers a newer launcher, or, after the player picked another channel, that
   channel's newest. *Update the launcher* downloads it beside the current file as `<name>.new` and checks it against
   `SHA256SUMS`. It starts it with `--self-check` (it must print `LongshotLauncher <version>` and exit 0 within a minute),
   then swaps the files:
   - Linux: one `rename()` over the AppImage.
   - Windows: the running exe is renamed aside, then the new one moved in; on failure the old one is put back.

   It then starts the new launcher and closes. `--rollback` puts the previous launcher back (`<name>.old`). A build from a
   checkout is `dev` and never updates itself.

### Installing the launcher

There is no installer program: the launcher installs itself (the launcher's README, *Installing*; `Core/Installer.cs`,
`LauncherLayout.cs`).

- **Windows, the setup file.** Its first start asks: **Install** copies it to
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\LongshotLauncher\LongshotLauncher.exe` for the user (no administrator rights), with a Start
  menu shortcut and an *Apps & features* entry, its data in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\LongshotLauncher`; **Run portable** puts a
  file named `portable` beside the program and keeps everything in `LongshotLauncher-data` beside it, with no registry
  or shortcut. `--install` installs without asking; `--uninstall` (what *Apps & features* runs) removes the program, its
  shortcuts and its entry, and asks before deleting its data (never a build's game folder or the saves).
- **Windows, the portable zip.** `LongshotLauncher.exe` with the `portable` marker already beside it, so it never asks.
- **Linux.** The AppImage needs no installing. *Settings > Applications menu > Add to applications menu* writes a
  `.desktop` entry that starts the AppImage where it is. Portable is the AppImage convention: a folder named
  `<AppImage>.home` beside it holds its data.
- **Updates keep the kind.** An installed launcher updates from the release's setup file, a portable one from the
  portable zip, in place beside its `portable` file; the file keeps its name.

`HOOKSHOT_LAUNCHER_TRUST=<public key .pem>` trusts one more key, to try a release signed with a test key.
`HOOKSHOT_LAUNCHER_PARTS=<list>` builds from a local parts list with no release at all (development).

## CI

Both repositories have the same workflows in `.forgejo/workflows/`, on Forgejo Actions:

| Workflow | Hookshot | The launcher |
|---|---|---|
| `ci.yml` | every pull request and push to main: the PR title, every game-free check (`tests/run_all.py`, on Linux) | the PR title, compile, `test_launcher_core.py`, `test_release.py` |
| `release.yml` | tags `v*` and pushes to main: the version, the two builders (`build-linux.yml`, `build-windows.yml`), sign and publish | tags `v*` and pushes to main: the version, the launcher (`scripts/package.sh`), sign and publish |
| `third-party.yml` | the third_party rule (`scripts/check_third_party.py`) | (none) |

Hookshot also keeps `build-linux.yml` and `build-windows.yml` (also run on pull requests that change code) and
`vulkan-dlss.yml` (the upscalers' build checks). Every job runs on Linux: Hookshot's Windows files are cross-built there,
and what only Windows can check is a tester's (RELEASING.md, *Needs a Windows tester*). The runners are in Hookshot's [docs/forgejo-runners.md](https://git.notrexed.dev/Hookshot/Hookshot/src/branch/main/docs/forgejo-runners.md).

## The version a tag must have

Pull requests are squash-merged, and their titles are Conventional Commits, so the commits on `main` say what changed. For
a tag, `scripts/release.py check-tag` (in `release.yml`, before anything is built) refuses:

- a name that is not `vX.Y.Z` or `vX.Y.Z-rc.N` of the product's numbers;
- a tag that is not on `main`;
- a tag that is not above every release there is (a stable `vX.Y.Z` is above its own `vX.Y.Z-rc.N`, so a stable tagged on
  the same commit as a release candidate is the normal way);
- a number lower than the commits since the last stable call for:

| Since the last stable | At least |
|---|---|
| a `!` after the type (`feat(vk)!:`) or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer | the next major (`v4.0.0` after `v3.2.1`) |
| a `feat` | the next minor (`v3.3.0`) |
| `fix`, `perf`, or anything else | the next patch (`v3.2.2`) |

The first release of each product only needs its first number (Hookshot `v3.0.0`, the launcher `v1.0.0`).
`python -I scripts/release.py next` prints the number and the notes before tagging.

## Release notes

git-cliff writes them at release time from the commit titles since the previous tag, with the repository's `cliff.toml`.
For a stable, that is since the previous stable, so its notes cover its release candidates. The headings are Features,
Fixes, Performance, Reverted, Documentation, Code, Build and Tests; `ci` and `chore` are left out. The notes go on the
release page only: nothing is committed back to `main`, and there is no changelog file to keep up. Hookshot's
`CHANGELOG.md` in Hookshot is history.

## RecompLauncher (Hookshot)

[RecompLauncher](https://recomplauncher.com) is the other way to install Hookshot. It installs a recomp from a release
file, then runs its `recomplauncher.json` (the game it needs, how to build and start it). Hookshot keeps that file
(`recomplauncher.json`, `tests/test_recomplauncher_json.py`) inside both builders, which are the same files the launcher
installs:

| File | What RecompLauncher does with it |
|---|---|
| `HookshotBuilder-<v>-windows-x64.zip` | *prepare* runs `HookshotBuilder.exe --cli --prepare --game <your copy>`: the setup installs the builder and the tools of the `tools.lock` beside it (no release lookup), then builds; *start* runs it with `--play` |
| `Hookshot-<v>-x86_64.AppImage` | the same `--cli --prepare` and `--play` |

**What RecompLauncher cannot do yet.** It finds releases only on GitHub. Its guide says it "installs and updates your recomp
straight from your GitHub releases", its `repo` is a GitHub `owner/name`, and its schema has no field for another forge or
a URL. So `recomplauncher.json` names no `repo`, and RecompLauncher cannot find Hookshot by itself. It needs either a
GitHub repository that mirrors these releases (there is none), or Forgejo support in RecompLauncher (a request to its
makers). Until then a player can add a downloaded zip or AppImage to RecompLauncher by hand, as a local build.

So there are two ways to install: **the Hookshot Launcher** (recommended: it follows channels, checks signatures and
updates everything), or **RecompLauncher**, with the same builder files.

## Why this design

- **Forgejo releases, not a package store and pointer files.** A release is what Forgejo already shows people: a tag, notes
  and files. The channels follow from the list, so there is nothing else to publish, keep in step or replay. Drafts make a
  release appear all at once.
- **A signature on the checksums.** HTTPS says a file came from git.magicbean.dev. A stolen token, a compromised runner or a
  mistake on the server would otherwise reach every player's PC, and the launcher runs what it installs. One signature
  over `SHA256SUMS` covers every file, however large.
- **tools.lock, not the tools in every release.** The tools change rarely and weigh gigabytes. A lock file in the repository
  says exactly which bytes each version needs; reviewers see a tool change as a one-line diff; installs share a tool
  across versions; and a release holds only Hookshot's own files.
- **Tags and computed numbers, not release PRs.** A maintainer tags; CI checks the number against what was merged and
  writes the notes. Nothing is committed back to `main`, so there is no release branch or bot commit to review.
- **The builders do not update themselves.** One updater, the launcher's, with one set of rules, instead of three (the
  game, the WPF builder, the Linux builder). The builders keep `--update <folder>`, which rebuilds a game with their
  own tools.
