"""Windows Intel's compiler is entered by one thread, and a fault creating a shader module leaves that program out.

Intel UHD on Windows (igvk64) read address 0x170 during the first scene and the process ended. The stack was two frames
in hookshot_vk.dll and then the thread start, and the log had no "driver faulted compiling" line, so the call was not
inside guarded_graphics or guarded_compute. vkCreateShaderModule (translation, the movie and upscale helpers, a masked
clear) and gpl_link's vkCreateGraphicsPipelines were not guarded, and graphics pipelines were still built side by side.
NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel on other systems are not held. The Debug tab's Intel shader compiles row (Intel graphics on
Windows only), or RX_VK_NO_INTEL_SERIAL over it, leaves them side by side. The renderer's own compute pipelines (ASTC, BC
and unswizzle, write-back diff, reactive mask, FSR 3.1 and its inputs and interpolation, frame generation, the
cooperative-matrix check) are guarded and held too: one of them built beside a worker's is the same two threads in it.
